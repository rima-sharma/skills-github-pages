I am a technical writer and editor based in Liverpool with 18 years of experience. My expertise lies in delivering **accurate, concise, and user-friendly content** in visually appealing formats.
I have worked in corporate environments and as an independent freelancer in India. I transitioned to freelancing after 13 years in full-time technical writing roles. This transition strengthened my ability to manage projects autonomously and deliver high-quality results. I am also a **top-rated freelancer** on Upwork with a **100% success rate**.
